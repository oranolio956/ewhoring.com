        <h2>Discord Script Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>Every successful Discord ewhoring interaction follows this structure: Hook → Rapport → Qualification → Objection Handling → Payment Request → Delivery.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hook</strong>: Something unique about your persona that stands out</li>
          <li><strong>Rapport</strong>: Find common interests and build emotional connection</li>
          <li><strong>Qualification</strong>: Confirm they're willing to pay for content/attention</li>
          <li><strong>Objection Handling</strong>: Address concerns about authenticity, safety, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Payment Request</strong>: Clear, confident ask with specific amount</li>
          <li><strong>Delivery</strong>: Provide value that keeps them coming back</li>
        </ul>
